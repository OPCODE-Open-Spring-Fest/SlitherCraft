# SlitherCraft

## Overview

Welcome to the project tour of **SlitherCraft** - a snake game implemented in C++ using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).

**SlitherCraft** is a classic snake game where players control a snake on a grid. The objective is to eat food pellets that appear randomly on the grid, which causes the snake to grow longer. As the snake grows, the game becomes more challenging as the player must avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. The game continues until the snake collides with a wall or itself.

## Features

1. **Snake Movement**
   - The snake moves continuously in the direction it's facing.
   - Players can control the direction of the snake using arrow keys (up, down, left, right).

2. **Food Pellets**
   - Food pellets appear randomly on the grid.
   - When the snake eats a food pellet, it grows longer.

3. **Score Tracking**
   - The game tracks the player's score, which increases each time the snake eats a food pellet.

4. **Game Over**
   - The game ends if the snake collides with a wall or its own body.
   - Upon game over, the player can choose to restart the game.

5. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
   - Implemented using the SFML library, providing a simple and intuitive interface for the game.

## Future Enhancements

- **Better the GUI**: Enhance the graphical user interface to improve the visual appeal and user experience of the game.
  
- **Implement Different Levels**: Introduce multiple levels with increasing difficulty to provide players with more challenges as they progress through the game.

- **Add Sound Effects and Background Music**: Enhance the immersive experience of the game by incorporating sound effects for actions such as snake movement, eating food pellets, and background music to set the mood.

- **Introduce Power-ups and Obstacles**: Spice up the gameplay by introducing power-ups that provide temporary benefits to the player or obstacles that increase the game's difficulty.

- **Implement Multiplayer Mode**: Allow players to compete against each other in real-time multiplayer mode, either locally or online, adding a competitive element to the game and increasing its replay value.
